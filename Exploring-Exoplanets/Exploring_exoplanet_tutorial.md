<h2 id="Steps">Step</h2>


###First Step
Finish query and submit. Query is on VESPA website.  
![Submit Query](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megadiesel705/tutorials/master/Exploring-Exoplanets/img/2_Query_Preparing.png)  
The query website is given below:  
![Query_Site](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megadiesel705/tutorials/master/Exploring-Exoplanets/img/2_Query_Address.png)  

###Second Step
Launch TOPCAT  
![TOPCAT Launch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megadiesel705/tutorials/master/Exploring-Exoplanets/img/3_Start_Top_Cat.png)  
This is how TOPCAT looks like:  
![TOPCAT UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megadiesel705/tutorials/master/Exploring-Exoplanets/img/4_TOPCAT.png)  

###Third Step
Back to page [VESPA Page](http://voparis-europlanet-new.obspm.fr/planetary/data/epn/query/submit/all/)  
Select **SAMPLEVOTABLE** in section called **Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia**. Image illustration is given below:  
![Image Illus.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megadiesel705/tutorials/master/Exploring-Exoplanets/img/4_SAMPVOTABLE.png)  
After click, the webpage shows up a dialog box in French. All you need to do is select "**Oui**", "Yes" in French.   
![Dialog Box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megadiesel705/tutorials/master/Exploring-Exoplanets/img/5_Oui_Yes.png)

### Fourth Step
The data is now in TOPCAT and you should be able to see it.  
![Data In TOPCAT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megadiesel705/tutorials/master/Exploring-Exoplanets/img/5_Data_In_TOPCAT.png)  

### Fifth Step
Using two circled buttons available on top of TOPCAT to display table and plot interface respectively.  
Below shows you which button opens table view.  
![TableView](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megadiesel705/tutorials/master/Exploring-Exoplanets/img/5_TableView.png)  
Below shows you how to open plot interface.  
![PlotView](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megadiesel705/tutorials/master/Exploring-Exoplanets/img/5_PlotView.png)  
In case that your TOPCAT shows different configuration of buttons on the top, move your mouse on each button longer and choose the one called *sky plotting window*.   

### Sixth Step
On plotting interface, please set up **Longitude Axis** to **c1min** and **Latitude Axis** to **c2min**. Then plot.   

After that, click from the table whatever element you want and see the selected element in the plot with circled in black.  
![Select Element & Plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megadiesel705/tutorials/master/Exploring-Exoplanets/img/6_Select_Element_Plot.png)

### Seventh Step
Choose again from TOPCAT's interface for specific information on Kepler-359b. Select Kepler-359b from table view.    
This time is the *plane plotting window*, shown below. In case icon is different from time to time, use the method mentioned in **fifth** step.  
![Kepler_359b Plane Plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megadiesel705/tutorials/master/Exploring-Exoplanets/img/7_Plane_Plot.png)  
Choose Axis like below:  
![Choose Axis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megadiesel705/tutorials/master/Exploring-Exoplanets/img/7_X_Y_Axis_Select.png)  
You should be able to see the plot now looks like following:  
![Plane Plot Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megadiesel705/tutorials/master/Exploring-Exoplanets/img/7_plane_Plot_outcome.png)  

Checking Kepler's 3rd law with formula given below:  
![Kepler 3rd Law](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megadiesel705/tutorials/master/Exploring-Exoplanets/img/7_Kepler_3_law.png)  

### Eighth Step
Now you can play with it.  
There's another trick you can play: plotting history plot using X and Y axis for *discoverd* and *period* respectively.
